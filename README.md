## ✅ Features (Issue-Based)

### \[#1] Implement User Authentication

* JWT-based stateless authentication
* Role-based access control for User/Admin
* Angular AuthGuard, interceptors, and token storage

### \[#2] Set Up Core App Structure

* Backend MVC setup with controllers, services, and repositories
* API versioning with `/api/v1/` endpoints
* Angular routing with lazy loading and modular architecture

### \[#3] Create Database Schema for Users and Transactions

* Tables: `users`, `ach_transactions`, `audit_logs`
* Liquibase changelogs for reproducible schema management

### \[#4] Develop ACH Transaction Data Model

* Entity: `AchTransaction`
* Fields: `senderAccount`, `receiverAccount`, `amount`, `status`, `createdAt`
* Enum for `status`: `PENDING`, `PROCESSED`, `FAILED`

### \[#5] Create UI/Form for ACH Transfer Submission

* Angular reactive form with validation (amount, account numbers)
* Integration with backend via Angular service
* Success and error notifications with Angular Material snackbar

### \[#6] Implement Backend Logic for ACH Processing

* Validations (formatting, account limits, duplicate prevention)
* Save to DB with `PENDING` status and timestamp
* Logging transaction metadata with SLF4J

### \[#7] Display ACH Transaction History for Users

* API filtered by logged-in user’s ID
* Angular material data table with pagination and filtering

### \[#8] Basic Error Handling and Logging

* `@ControllerAdvice` for exception mapping
* Centralized logging with SLF4J and Logback
* Angular global error interceptor with UI fallback

## Running Locally

### Backend

```bash
cd server
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
ng serve
```

> PostgreSQL must be running with the expected schema and credentials. Use Docker Compose for local database provisioning.

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

* GitHub Actions workflows:

  * Linting
  * Unit testing (backend & frontend)
  * Docker image build & push
  * Staging deployment via Docker Compose or Kubernetes
* Includes `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
